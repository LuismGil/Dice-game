# DICE GAME

Refactoring the typical dice game, made 100% with HTML, JavaScript and Scss.

To enter the game please click here -> [ðŸŽ²](https://luismgil.github.io/Dice-game/).

The game consists of two players, the first to accumulate a score of 100 points wins.

## Instructions:

- Each player will roll the dice to get a random number and will accumulate a previous score.

- In case the player gets the number 1, he will lose his previous score and it will be the turn of the other player.

- For each player to save his previous score, he must click on the "hold" button and it will be added to his score.

- Each player by clicking on the "hold" button will be saving his score and giving the other player a chance to participate.

Basically that, I hope you like this game and you can play it with a friend (:
